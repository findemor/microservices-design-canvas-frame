# microservices-design-canvas-frame

We have worked in a json spec based on the Microservice Design Canvas from Capital One. 
This specification can be included and stored in the same microservice's source code repository (or even versioned :S), and embed in documentation related to the microservice.

This online editor allows to easily edit and generate canvas in a digital way.

This tool has been developed by Solusoft

## MDC Specification

You can consult example and json schema specification in the __specs__ folder.
